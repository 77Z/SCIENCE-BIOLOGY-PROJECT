		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ve got questions,
		and I’m here to answer ‘em! First off, what’s a Game Warden? Game
		Wardens, also known as Conservation Wardens, have a vast and wide
		variety of skills that help them with their duties. Ok, so what does a
		Game Warden do? They spend most of their time on field almost acting
		like a police officer of nature. Sometimes you will hear them as Game
		and Fish Wardens, because they regulate fish too, and if you didn’t
		know, game, refers to hunting because they regulate that too. I’ve heard
		some sources refer to Game Wardens as detectives because they have to
		hunt down and capture poachers, and depending on what kind of poaching
		is happening, it can be really hard to determine if someone is poaching,
		or if they’re genuinely hunting. Because you can’t check everything.
		Again, it might be easier to find people hunting with laser sights(which
		is not allowed) than it might be to find people with 100% valid hunting
		or fishing licences, or if they’re using a legal firearm.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough with the
		questions, let’s talk about how and why you might want to become a game
		warden. As said before, they do tons of different things, and you can’t
		just be anyone looking to become a Game Warden, there’s some pretty
		strict requirements. First off, you need to be at least 21 years old
		because you’ll be dealing with firearms and similar things, you’re
		basically a police officer of nature, so you never know what you’re
		going to come across. You also have to be physically fit, you’ll be
		running, jumping, climbing and navigating rough terrain, sometimes, even
		chasing down people in different environments. Game Wardens are expected
		to know everything about wildlife regulations to make sure people are
		within the legal limits. You’re going to have to get a boating license,
		practice water rescues, learn defensive tactics, drive many kinds of
		4-wheel offroad vehicles, first aid, law enforcement, firearm training,
		and again, you must be physically fit.
