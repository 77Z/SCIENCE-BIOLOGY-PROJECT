Vince\n</div>\n\n<Content>\n\t<p>\n\t\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ve got questions,\n\t\tand I’m here to answer ‘em! First off, what’s a Game Warden? Game\n\t\tWardens, also known as Conservation Wardens, have a vast and wide\n\t\tvariety of skills that help them with their duties. Ok, so what does a\n\t\tGame Warden do? They spend most of their time on field almost acting\n\t\tlike a police officer of nature. Sometimes you will hear them as Game\n\t\tand Fish Wardens, because they regulate fish too, and if you didn’t\n\t\tknow, game, refers to hunting because they regulate that too. I’ve heard\n\t\tsome sources refer to Game Wardens as detectives because they have to\n\t\thunt down and capture poachers, and depending on what kind of poaching\n\t\tis happening, it can be really hard to determine if someone is poaching,\n\t\tor if they’re genuinely hunting. Because you can’t check everything.\n\t\tAgain, it might be easier to find people hunting with laser sights(which\n\t\tis not allowed) than it might be to find people with 100% valid hunting\n\t\tor fishing licences, or if they’re using a legal firearm.\n\t</p>\n\t<img src=\"/warden.png\" alt=\"Game Warden\" />\n\t<p>\n\t\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough with the\n\t\tquestions, let’s talk about how and why you might want to become a game\n\t\twarden. As said before, they do tons of different things, and you can’t\n\t\tjust be anyone looking to become a Game Warden, there’s some pretty\n\t\tstrict requirements. First off, you need to be at least 21 years old\n\t\tbecause you’ll be dealing with firearms and similar things, you’re\n\t\tbasically a police officer of nature, so you never know what you’re\n\t\tgoing to come across. You also have to be physically fit, you’ll be\n\t\trunning, jumping, climbing and navigating rough terrain, sometimes, even\n\t\tchasing down people in different environments. Game Wardens are expected\n\t\tto know everything about wildlife regulations to make sure people are\n\t\twithin the legal limits. You’re going to have to get a boating license,\n\t\tpractice water rescues, learn defensive tactics, drive many kinds of\n\t\t4-wheel offroad vehicles, first aid, law enforcement, firearm training,\n\t\tand again, you must be physically fit.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What colleges would help\n\t\tyou become a Game Warden?
